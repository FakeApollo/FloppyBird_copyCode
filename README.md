## Introduction
Floppy Bird is a 2D game where you control a bird trying to fly through obstacles (pipes). The objective is to pass as many pipes as possible without colliding with them or falling to the ground.

## Installation
To run Floppy Bird on your Windows machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    Open Command Prompt and run:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FakeApollo/FloppyBird_copyCode.git
    cd floppy-bird
    ```

2. **Compile the Code:**
    Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. If not, download and install it from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

    ```

3. **Run the Game:**

## How to Play
